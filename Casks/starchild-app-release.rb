  # PREBUILT channel: CI cross-compiles StarChild.app per architecture and
  # publishes the zips alongside the CLI. This is the fast install path —
  # `brew install --cask starchild-app-release` downloads a finished app
  # instead of compiling the whole Rust + Node project locally (the source
  # formula, `brew install starchild-app`, can take hours on Intel Macs where
  # Homebrew provides no bottles).
  #
  # Unsigned on purpose (no Apple Developer cert): brew downloads via curl,
  # which never sets the quarantine xattr, so Gatekeeper does not assess the
  # app — the same mechanism the source formula has always relied on.
